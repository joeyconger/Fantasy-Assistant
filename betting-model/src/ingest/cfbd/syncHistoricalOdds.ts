/**
 * Verified against real CFBD responses: ingested 2024 CFB odds spot-checked
 * against known results (e.g. Georgia Tech's upset of Florida State,
 * Vanderbilt's upset of Virginia Tech, Georgia over Clemson, Minnesota/UNC
 * crossing from home-favored to away-favored) — spread sign convention and
 * values were internally consistent and correct with no negation needed.
 * This is CFB's only candidate for a *both* opening-and-closing odds source
 * (nflverse, used for NFL, is closing-only).
 *
 * CFBD doesn't give real per-line timestamps, so captured_at is a rough
 * proxy: kickoff for closing, kickoff minus 6 days for opening. Only
 * matters as a NOT NULL placeholder here — getOpeningLine/getClosingLine
 * filter by snapshot_type first and this only ever inserts one row per
 * type per game, so the exact timestamp doesn't affect which row a lookup
 * returns.
