 * Incremental, EPA-driven Elo-like rating system. Unlike a classic Elo
 * (updated from win/loss or final score margin), the "ground truth" each
 * game feeds in is that game's net EPA/play differential — offense minus
 * defense for each side, converted to a point-margin equivalent — since
 * the spec calls for updating from EPA/success-rate form, not the scoreboard.
 *
 * SOS shows up here directly: each team's rating movement is scaled by how
 * strong their opponent's rating already is (sosWeight, higher for CFB),
 * so beating a good team moves the rating more than beating a bad one —
 * the standard way Elo-family systems encode strength of schedule.
 *
 * This is a single incremental pass through the season in week order, not
 * a fully converged iterative solve (early-week opponent ratings are still
 * close to their preseason prior) — a reasonable v1 scope, and one Phase 3
 * can compare against a multi-pass version if the single pass underperforms.

  // modelSpreadHome is a weighted average of eloSpreadHome and market, and

  // to the other side of it, meaning pickSide (and therefore cover rate

  // how strong the damping. Confirmed empirically: a real sweep of
  // bigSpreadShrinkRef from 5 to 1000 produced bit-for-bit identical cover
  // rate and avgClv every time.
  //
  // Real fix: since the model's rating scale is demonstrably compressed
  // relative to true blowout magnitudes (real CFB mismatches routinely hit
  // 30-50+ points; this incremental, regression-heavy rating system can't
  // accumulate that much separation within a season), a big disagreement
  // with an already-extreme market spread is a signal the prediction is
  // LESS trustworthy, not a reason to change which side gets picked.
  // bigSpreadShrinkRef widens `confidence` (not modelWeight) as
  // |marketSpreadHome| grows, so a confidence-based filter (getConfidenceReport,
  // or a future live threshold) naturally screens these out — same

  // excluding rivalry week already validated, rather than trying to
  // out-guess the market's own number.
